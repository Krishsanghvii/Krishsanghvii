# **Krish Sanghvi**

## **Overview**
This repository contains my personal projects, research, and experiences in **Data Science**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Machine Learning**. I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science** at **George Mason University** and have previously completed a **Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** from the **University of Mumbai**.

## **Projects**

### 1. **E-commerce Web Support Tools**  
- **Technologies**: Python, Hugging Face, XGBoost, Streamlit, Binance API, MTCNN, VGG16, CNN, Flask  
- **Details**: Developed tools for sentiment analysis (80% accuracy), text summarization, and a crypto trading app with price prediction using XGBoost. Also created a computer vision model for car brand identification and facial recognition.

### 2. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Technologies**: Python, Selenium, Twitter API  
- **Details**: Analyzed historical tweets to identify trends related to machine learning and AI topics. Scraped data and used machine learning to detect patterns across different countries.

### 3. **God’s Eye (GANs for Facial Image Generation)**  
- **Technologies**: GANs, Python, Stable Diffusion, Kaggle  
- **Details**: Generated realistic facial images using GANs, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in facial similarity metrics. Trained on over 100,000 images to improve image generation diversity.

### 4. **Supernovae Classification**  
- **Technologies**: CNN, Random Forest, LightGBM, MLP, KNN  
- **Details**: Published a paper on deep learning classification models for supernovae light curve data. CNNs outperformed other models, achieving a high AUC of 0.8425, recall of 0.9896, and precision of 0.8617.

## **Technical Skills**
- **Languages**: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, R, SQL, PHP  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost, LangChain  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, RStudio, Apache Hadoop, Power BI, Google Colab  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyCaret, HuggingFace  
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Trees, K-means, KNN, LSTMs, CNNs, GANs, DNNs, SVMs

## **Education**
- **George Mason University**  
  Master of Science in Computer Science (Aug 2024 – May 2026)  
  Relevant Coursework: Data Mining, System Programming, Mathematical Foundations of CS

- **University of Mumbai**  
  Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CGPA: 7.99/10)  
  Relevant Coursework: AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing

## **Experience**

### **Artificial Intelligence Intern - Intel Technologies**  
*June 2023 – October 2023*  
- Developed AI-based e-commerce tools for sentiment analysis and text summarization.  
- Built a crypto trading app and used XGBoost for price prediction and Binance API for real-time trading.  
- Created a computer vision model for car brand identification and implemented facial recognition using MTCNN.

## **How to Run My Projects**
### **Setup**:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishsanghvii/AI-DataScience-Projects.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For specific projects like **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** or **Supernovae Classification**, navigate to the project folder and follow the instructions in the respective `README` files.

### **Running the Models**:
- Each project typically comes with Python scripts that can be run from the command line, and some might require additional setup like API keys or dataset downloads.
